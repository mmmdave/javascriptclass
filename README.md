this is a repository for the udemy java script class. these files were downloaded (zip) from instructor site onto ipad in Downloads folder.
the reason to create a repository is to get used to github, but more importantly, i can use the embedded vscode environment in the browser
if i'm on github.com. this way, i can work on ipad instead of only desktop

couldn't figure out how to import the entire folders of udemy code to repository, (as folders) so am just grabbing eachfile when needed
